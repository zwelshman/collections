### Medical Device Electrode Production at Intelesens

#### Project Overview

At Intelesens, a company specializing in wireless medical devices for vital sign detection, I was involved in the production of medical-grade electrodes. These electrodes were critical components in various medical devices, including defibrillators, nutrition analysis machines, and ECG equipment.

#### Company Background

Intelesens designs innovative wireless medical devices that primarily focus on detecting cardiac arrhythmias. Their products utilize intelligent software and advanced electrode technology to monitor vital signs remotely

#### My Role and Responsibilities

As part of the production team, my primary responsibilities included:

* Overseeing the entire electrode production process, from raw materials to the final packaged product
* Ensuring adherence to strict medical-grade quality standards
* Collaborating with the R\&D team to implement improvements in electrode design and manufacturing processes
* Managing inventory and supply chain for electrode production materials

#### Key Achievements

* Contributed to the development of a new electrode design that improved signal quality in ECG readings

#### Technologies and Skills Utilized

* Medical-grade material handling and processing
* Clean room manufacturing protocols
* Quality control and assurance in medical device production
* Knowledge of ECG, defibrillator, and nutrition analysis device requirements
* Familiarity with FDA and CE marking regulations for medical devices

#### Impact

The electrodes produced during my tenure played a crucial role in Intelesens' wireless vital sign monitoring devices, particularly in their flagship product, the Zensor. This 3-lead ECG respiration and accelerometer device provides remote cardiac event monitoring, contributing to improved patient care and early detection of heart arrhythmias\[14]\[17].

This experience deepened my understanding of medical device manufacturing and the critical role of high-quality components in healthcare technology. It also honed my skills in managing complex production processes and maintaining stringent quality standards in a highly regulated industry.
