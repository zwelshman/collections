# Data Can

## Cancer Research Data Science Lead

As a lead data scientist for national cancer research programs, I leverage cutting-edge technologies and cloud platforms to drive impactful analyses and develop robust data pipelines. My work focuses on translating academic research questions into practical engineered solutions within the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics and the School of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health.

### Key Responsibilities and Achievements

* **Advanced Analytics Pipeline Development:** Led the creation of analytical pipelines using Apache Spark via Databricks for the NHS Digital Cancer Trusted Research Environment (TRE). This work has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of cancer trends and treatment efficacy at a national level.
* **Cloud-Based Research Infrastructure:** Spearheaded DataCan projects on Google Cloud Platform, leveraging its suite of tools to enhance our research capabilities and data processing efficiency.
* **Machine Learning and Deep Learning Implementation:** Enhanced data science capabilities by implementing advanced machine learning and deep learning models on AWS Databricks and Google Cloud Platform. These models have improved our predictive capabilities in cancer research.
* **Containerized Data Pipeline Orchestration:** Designed and implemented containerized data pipelines using Google Cloud services, including Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, Workflows, and Composer (Apache Airflow). This approach has significantly improved the scalability and reproducibility of our research workflows.
* **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Conducted in-depth data analysis using Google Cloud BigQuery and AI Notebooks, primarily programming in Python. Visualized complex datasets using Google Data Studio to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
* **Research Translation:** Bridged the gap between academic research questions and practical engineered solutions, ensuring that our data science work directly contributes to advancements in cancer research and patient care.

### Technologies and Platforms
