# Health Data Research UK

## British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre Projects

### Overview

As part of the CVD-COVID-UK / COVID-IMPACT initiative at the British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre, I contributed to groundbreaking research analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on cardiovascular health and other medical conditions across the UK population.

### Key Contributions

#### Large-Scale Data Analysis

* Conducted phenome-wide association analysis on 47 million patient records within the NHS England Secure Data Environment
* Utilized Databricks and PySpark to process and analyze massive datasets efficiently
* Developed a comprehensive disease/prognostic atlas to study COVID-19's impact on various patient groups

#### Advanced AI Implementation

* Spearheaded technical initiatives to apply cutting-edge AI algorithms, including large language models
* Enhanced question-answering capabilities to improve data interpretation and insights

#### Data Insight Generation

* Produced valuable insights for researchers by analyzing diverse healthcare datasets:
  * Primary care data (GDPPR and Primary Care Medicines)
  * Hospital Episode Statistics (APC, OP, AE)
  * Emergency Care Dataset (EDCS)

### Impact

This project contributes to the broader goals of the BHF Data Science Centre in enabling data-driven research to improve cardiovascular health outcomes. By leveraging large-scale health data and advanced analytics, we're helping to uncover crucial insights into the relationship between COVID-19 and various health conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases.
