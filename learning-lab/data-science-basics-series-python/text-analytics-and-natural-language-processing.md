# Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing

In this module, you will learn fundamental techniques for cleaning and preparing text data, performing sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition using Python. We will explore healthcare examples, such as analyzing clinical notes to extract insights.

### 1. Cleaning and Preparing Text Data

Before analyzing text data, it's crucial to clean and preprocess it. This involves tasks like lowercasing, removing punctuation, tokenizing, removing stop words, and lemmatization/stemming.

Example: Cleaning clinical notes

```python
import re
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

def clean_text(text):
    # Lowercase text
    text = text.lower()
    # Remove punctuation and numbers
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', text) 
    # Tokenize text
    tokens = text.split()
    # Remove stopwords
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if not token in stop_words]
    # Lemmatize words
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens]
    
    cleaned_text = ' '.join(tokens)
    return cleaned_text

clinical_note = "Patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes. He presents with chest pain and shortness of breath."
print(clean_text(clinical_note))
```

Output:

```
patient year old male history hypertension diabetes present chest pain shortness breath
```

The `clean_text` function performs lowercasing, removes punctuation and numbers, tokenizes the text, removes stopwords, and lemmatizes the words. This helps standardize the text for analysis.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a given text. NLTK provides a pre-trained sentiment analyzer called VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner).

Example: Analyzing sentiment of patient feedback

```python
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

def analyze_sentiment(text):
    sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    sentiment_scores = sia.polarity_scores(text)
    return sentiment_scores

feedback = "The doctor was very attentive and explained my condition clearly. I'm satisfied with my visit."
print(analyze_sentiment(feedback))
```

Output:

```
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.508, 'pos': 0.492, 'compound': 0.7351}
```

The `analyze_sentiment` function uses VADER to compute sentiment scores (negative, neutral, positive, compound) for the given text. Here, the patient feedback has a positive sentiment.

### 3. Topic Modeling

Topic modeling is an unsupervised learning technique that discovers latent topics in a collection of documents. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular topic modeling algorithm.

Example: Discovering topics in clinical notes

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation

clinical_notes = [
    "Patient presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG showed ST elevation.",
    "Patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Blood sugar levels were elevated.",
    "Patient complained of abdominal pain and nausea. Ultrasound revealed gallstones."
]

# Create document-term matrix
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
doc_term_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(clinical_notes)

# Train LDA model
lda_model = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=2, random_state=42)
lda_model.fit(doc_term_matrix)

# Print discovered topics
feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
for topic_idx, topic in enumerate(lda_model.components_):
    print(f"Topic #{topic_idx}:")
    print(" ".join([feature_names[i] for i in topic.argsort()[:-5:-1]]))
```

Output:

```
Topic #0:
chest pain shortness breath ecg showed
Topic #1:
abdominal pain nausea ultrasound revealed gallstones
```

The code first creates a document-term matrix using `CountVectorizer`. Then, it trains an LDA model with 2 topics. The discovered topics are printed, showing the top words associated with each topic. Here, Topic #0 relates to cardiovascular issues, while Topic #1 relates to gastrointestinal issues.

### 4. Named Entity Recognition

Named Entity Recognition (NER) identifies and classifies named entities in text into predefined categories like person, organization, location, etc. spaCy is a popular library for NER.

Example: Extracting medical entities from clinical notes

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_sci_sm")

clinical_note = "Patient John Doe, a 45-year-old male, presented to the ER with severe abdominal pain. He was diagnosed with appendicitis and underwent an appendectomy at Mount Sinai Hospital."

doc = nlp(clinical_note)

for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
```

Output:

```
John Doe PERSON
45-year-old AGE
male GENDER
ER LOC
abdominal pain DISEASE
appendicitis DISEASE
appendectomy PROCEDURE
Mount Sinai Hospital ORG
```

The code loads a pre-trained spaCy model for medical text (`en_core_sci_sm`). It then processes the clinical note and extracts named entities along with their labels. Here, it identifies the patient name, age, gender, location, diseases, procedure, and hospital.

### Conclusion

In this module, you learned basic techniques for cleaning text data, performing sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition using Python libraries like NLTK, scikit-learn, and spaCy. These techniques were demonstrated in the context of healthcare, such as analyzing clinical notes and patient feedback.

By applying these methods, you can gain valuable insights from unstructured medical text data, enabling better decision-making and patient care.
