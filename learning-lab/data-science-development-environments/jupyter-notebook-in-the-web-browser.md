# Jupyter Notebook in the Web Browser

JupyterLite is a web-based version of Jupyter Notebook that runs entirely in the browser, without requiring any server-side components or installations. It provides a lightweight and accessible way to create, edit, and run Jupyter notebooks directly in a web browser.&#x20;

JupyterLite leverages WebAssembly and Pyodide to execute Python code and other languages supported by Jupyter kernels entirely on the client-side. This means users can start working with notebooks immediately, without the need to set up a local environment or connect to a remote server.&#x20;

JupyterLite offers many of the familiar features of traditional Jupyter notebooks, including code execution, Markdown support, and interactive widgets, all within a browser-based interface. This makes it an excellent tool for quick prototyping, educational purposes, or sharing interactive data analysis and visualizations with others who may not have Jupyter installed locally.
