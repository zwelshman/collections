# Time Series Analysis in Healthcare

Welcome to this training module on using Python for time series analysis in healthcare! In this module, we'll cover the key concepts of time series data, how to identify trends, seasonality and noise, techniques for smoothing and filtering data, and how to build forecasting models using ARIMA. Throughout, we'll apply these concepts to a healthcare example of forecasting patient volume in emergency departments.

### Trends, Seasonality and Noise in Time Series Data

Time series data in healthcare often exhibits three key components:

1. **Trend**: The overall long-term direction or pattern in the data. For example, patient volume in an ER may show an increasing trend over several years due to population growth.
2. **Seasonality**: Repeating patterns or cycles in the data. ER visits often have daily and weekly seasonality, with higher volume on weekends and evenings. There can also be annual seasonality due to factors like flu season.
3. **Noise**: The random fluctuations and variability in the data not captured by the trend or seasonality.

Here's an example of visualizing these components in Python using the `statsmodels` library. We'll use a dataset of daily patient volume in an emergency department over 3 years.

```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load ER visit data 
data = pd.read_csv('er_visits.csv', index_col='date', parse_dates=True)

# Decompose the time series 
decomposition = seasonal_decompose(data)

# Plot the components
fig, (ax1,ax2,ax3,ax4) = plt.subplots(4,1, figsize=(10,8))
decomposition.observed.plot(ax=ax1)
ax1.set_ylabel('Observed')
decomposition.trend.plot(ax=ax2)
ax2.set_ylabel('Trend')  
decomposition.seasonal.plot(ax=ax3)
ax3.set_ylabel('Seasonal')
decomposition.resid.plot(ax=ax4)
ax4.set_ylabel('Residual')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This produces the following plot:

Time Series Decomposition Plot

The top plot shows the original observed ER visit data. The decomposition then splits this into:

* The overall increasing trend
* The repeating weekly seasonal pattern
* The residual noise left over

Understanding these underlying patterns is crucial for building accurate time series forecasting models.

### Smoothing and Filtering Time Series Data

Real-world time series data often has a lot of noise that can obscure the underlying patterns we're interested in. Smoothing and filtering techniques help remove this noise to better expose the signal.

The most common smoothing method is the moving average, which replaces each data point with the average of the neighboring data points over a specified window. Here's an example of smoothing the ER visit data with moving averages:

```python
# Calculate 7-day and 30-day moving average
data['7_day_MA'] = data['visits'].rolling(window=7).mean()
data['30_day_MA'] = data['visits'].rolling(window=30).mean()

# Plot original and smoothed data
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,4))
data[['visits','7_day_MA','30_day_MA']].plot(ax=ax)
ax.set_ylabel('ER Visits')
plt.show()
```

Output: Smoothed ER Visit Data

The 7-day moving average (orange line) removes some of the day-to-day noise while preserving the weekly seasonal pattern. The 30-day moving average (green line) smooths out the data even more to highlight the overall trend.

Choosing the right window size depends on the specific patterns in your data that you want to expose or remove. Too small and the data will still be noisy, too large and you may lose important details.

### Forecasting with ARIMA Models

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is one of the most widely used methods for time series forecasting. It combines autoregressive terms (lagged values of the variable of interest) with moving average terms (lagged forecast errors).

Here's an example of fitting an ARIMA model to forecast future ER visits:

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

# Fit ARIMA(1,1,1) model
model = ARIMA(data['visits'], order=(1,1,1))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Make 30 day forecast
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=30)

# Plot the forecast
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,4))
data['visits'].plot(ax=ax, label='Observed')
forecast.plot(ax=ax, label='Forecast')
ax.set_ylabel('ER Visits')
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

Output: ARIMA Forecast

The ARIMA model captures the overall trend and seasonality to make a 30-day forecast (blue line) of future ER visits. The order (1,1,1) specifies:

* 1 autoregressive term
* 1 differencing to make the data stationary
* 1 moving average term

Choosing the right order is crucial for getting accurate forecasts. This is often done through an iterative process of fitting models with different orders and comparing their performance on held-out test data.

### Conclusion

In this module, we covered the basics of working with time series data in Python for healthcare applications. We saw how to identify trends, seasonality and noise, smooth data with moving averages, and build ARIMA forecasting models.

The key takeaways are:

1. Visualizing and decomposing your time series is an important first step to understand the underlying patterns.
2. Smoothing can help remove noise and better expose the signal, but the window size needs to be chosen carefully.
3. ARIMA is a powerful tool for time series forecasting, but getting the model order right is crucial for accurate predictions.
4. Always validate your models on held-out test data to get a realistic estimate of real-world performance.

I hope this gives you a solid foundation for applying time series analysis to your own healthcare projects! Let me know if you have any other questions.
